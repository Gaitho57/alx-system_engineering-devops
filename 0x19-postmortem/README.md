Outage Postmortem: Service Interruption on Web Stack 
Issue Summary 
Duration: 5 hours, from 9:00 AM to 2:00 PM (UTC-5)
Impact: The web application experienced intermittent service interruptions, resulting in slow response times and periodic unavailability for
users. Approximately 15% of the total users were affected.
Root Cause: A misconfigured load balancer caused excessive traffic to overwhelm the database servers, leading to high CPU and memory
usage. 
Timeline 
9:00 AM: The issue was detected when multiple monitoring alerts indicated increased response times.
9:15 AM: Engineers were notified about the performance degradation by the monitoring system.
9:30 AM: Initial investigation focused on the web servers, assuming misconfiguration or increased demand caused the issue.
10:00 AM: Debugging paths initially explored included checking for DNS issues and analyzing server logs, but no actionable insights were
found.
11:00 AM: With no progress, the incident was escalated to the database team to examine database performance.
12:00 PM: Further investigation revealed high CPU and memory utilization on the database servers.
12:30 PM: Load balancer configuration was identified as the root cause, leading to an influx of requests being ineffectively distributed.
1:00 PM: The misconfiguration was resolved by properly configuring the load balancer.
2:00 PM: All services were restored, and response times returned to normal. 
Root Cause and Resolution 
The root cause of the service interruption was a misconfigured load balancer. Instead of evenly distributing incoming requests to the database
servers, it directed excessive traffic to a single server, overwhelming its capacity. This caused high CPU and memory usage, resulting in slow
response times and occasional unavailability. 
To resolve the issue, the load balancer configuration was modified to distribute requests evenly across all available database servers. This ensured
traffic was evenly balanced, mitigating the strain on any individual server. As a result, the CPU and memory usage returned to normal levels,
resolving the performance degradation. 
Corrective and Preventative Measures 
To prevent a similar incident in the future, the following measures will be implemented: 
Regular Load Testing: Conduct load testing to ensure the load balancer configuration can handle expected volumes of traffic and distribute
it evenly among the servers.
Failover Mechanism: Implement a failover mechanism to redirect traffic to healthy database servers in case of failures or increased load on
a specific server.
Increased Monitoring: Enhance monitoring systems to provide better visibility into resource utilization, enabling early detection and alerts
for unusual traffic patterns or server loads.
Automated Configuration Validation: Develop automated checks to verify load balancer configurations, ensuring they conform to best
practices and distribute traffic effectively.
Incident Response Training: Conduct training for the operations team on incident response protocols and troubleshooting techniques to
expedite identification and resolution of issues. 
Specific tasks to address the recent incident include: - Review load balancer configurations across all environments, applying standardized
settings. - Implement automated tests to validate load balancer configurations during deployment. - Enhance monitoring system to include
performance metrics from both web and database servers. - Develop runbooks for incident response, clarifying escalation procedures and
troubleshooting steps. 
By implementing these measures, we aim to proactively address potential issues, improve system stability, and ensure uninterrupted service for
our users. 
In conclusion, the service interruption was caused by a misconfigured load balancer, unevenly distributing traffic to the database servers. After
identifying and resolving the misconfiguration, normal service operation was restored. Moving forward, we will focus on preventive measures and
regular testing to minimize the chances of similar incidents occurring again.
